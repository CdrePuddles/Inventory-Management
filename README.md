# Inventory Management System
### A system designed to manage the inventory of sole proprietorships and small businesses.

This inventory system was devised out of a need for a cost-effective solution to manage the inventory of small 
businesses.
The inspiration for this project came from my father, who runs his own small home automation business, and presently 
manages his inventory of thousands of items using a rudimentary and often unreliable Microsoft Excel-based solution. 
The items he has in his workshop ranges in sizes and scope from large TVs and speakers, to small, visually identical, 
yet unique pieces.

Many off-the-shelf solutions already exist, however they often have _too much_ functionality.  This leads to not only a 
higher purchasing cost for the small business, but also confusing layers of additional and unnecessary features. 
<br><br>
As a result, it is imperative that this inventory management system maintains the following core competencies:
- Simplistic in its accessibility for the user
- Easily digestible for new users to understand with little training and manual-referencing, and
- Able to scale up or down with however many inventory items a user may desire
